  h2 Introduction
  p Hello, welcome to my Lab 3 page. This website is continued work from lab2. During this time, I create the Sqlite3 database to store and present the console log. On this site you can create a contact database where you can fill in your last name, first name, email and note. Among other things, the site automatically generates a contact ID as a key for each message and the time you last clicked on the data. User also allowed to edit and delete the record they want.
