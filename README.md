**Project Description** - LAB2 CONTINUED!!! This project allows users to look at contact information, insert, edit, and delete contact information. Users are able to input the first name, last name, an email address, and a note to create a contact(first,last name are the required filed, cannt be empty!). The contact ID will be automatically generated as the unique auothorized key. When user open/click any record, site will generate current local time, these two filed only present on 'contact page'

**Development Environment** 

1: MacBook Air Apple M2 

2: Node JS version v20.5.1 

3: GitHub Desktop 

4: Visual Studio Code

**Insight and Resaults** - So far so good, one of the small issue that I met is "How to delete the ids while deleting the records, because I found that after deleting the records, the id of each record are still being added automatically."

**Installation/Running Instructions** â€“ In order to run the app, you are going to have to make sure NodeJS is installed. Once it is installed, you would then need to clone this repository to your computer. Next, you are going to need to open your command line and go to the directory of the cloned repository. Once there you are located at the "../ITMD442_Lab3/ITMD422Lab2" you need to type *npm i* to install the dependencies. Next, you need to type: npm run start/dev. Finally, you can type Localhost:3000 to see the index.
